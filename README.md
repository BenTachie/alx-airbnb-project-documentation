# Airbnb Clone Backend Documentation

## Overview
The **Airbnb Clone** is a backend application designed to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb. It provides a RESTful API (or GraphQL) for handling user accounts, property listings, booking reservations, and payment processing.  

This documentation serves as a blueprint for the system, detailing everything from high-level feature lists to low-level API specifications before development begins.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this documentation project, you will be able to:

- Translate project requirements into a structured list of features and functionalities.
- Model system interactions visually using **Use Case Diagrams** to identify actors and their goals.
- Articulate user needs with **User Stories** to guide development from a user-centric perspective.
- Map data movement through the system using **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)** to understand information processing.
- Detail specific processes using **Flowcharts** to define logical sequences and decision points.
- Write precise **technical specifications** that define API endpoints, data validation, and system behavior for developers.
- Utilize diagramming tools like **Draw.io / Diagrams.net** to create professional and clear technical diagrams.

## Key Concepts

### Backend Architecture
Structure of the server-side application, including:
- **Routers** – Handle incoming HTTP requests.
- **Controllers** – Manage the logic for each endpoint.
- **Models** – Define database schemas and relationships.
- **Services** – Encapsulate business logic.

### RESTful API Design
- Create endpoints adhering to REST principles using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Data Modeling
- Design database schemas using SQL (PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB) to efficiently store and relate:
  - Users
  - Properties
  - Bookings
  - Payments

### Authentication & Authorization
- Implement **AuthN** (user verification) and **AuthZ** (resource access control) using JWTs and secure password hashing.

### Payment Gateway Integration
- Securely process payments using third-party services such as **Stripe** or **PayPal**.

### Documentation
- Maintain clear, comprehensive, and easily understandable guides and technical specifications.

## Real-World Use Case
This documentation simulates the early phases of the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** in a professional setting. Key outputs include:

- **Product Requirements Document (PRD):** Feature list (Task 0)
- **System Design Mockups:** Use Case & Data Flow diagrams (Tasks 1 & 3)
- **Agile/Scrum Backlog Items:** User Stories (Task 2)
- **Technical Specifications:** Detailed API and requirements documentation (Task 5)

This ensures alignment among Product Managers, System Analysts, Technical Leads, and Developers, reducing errors and providing a clear roadmap for the engineering team.
